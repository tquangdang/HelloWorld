## Notes
Since this is my first time using Android Studio, it is very difficult for me to be familiar with the user interface at the first place. I had to spent hours looking up errors on Google in order to correct my code and successfully pushed it to Github. It is a bit challenging for me to code in an entirely new language: Kotlin. However, I have successfully made my first Android app, and I'm really happy about it! I hope that I can learn more about Kotlin in the future.
